# Moving to Gitlab
## I'm quitting GitHub
I won't be uploading new projects on GitHub or working on existing ones anymore. I keep my account active, but I won't be logging in. I will move all my repositories to GitLab, where I'll be from now one.
## Why?
GitHub belongs to Microsoft.
## How to keep connected now?
To join me on another platform in order to stay connected and boycott Microsoft (amongst others lol), add me via this link: [my gitlab profile]([661515](https://gitlab.com/mogw4i)).
See you there!
